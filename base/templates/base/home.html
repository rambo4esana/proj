                <hr>
                <p>Since October 2017, Mihail Kasabov has been a student at the TH Georg Simon Ohm in Nuremberg,
                    where he not only has the opportunity to learn, but also apply his newly acquired knowledge from
                    different subjects..</p>

                <p>While being a motivated and big-picture person, he not only works on testing his knowledge,
                    but also tends to create projects, which will be of use in the future.</p>

                <p>In short, Mihail Kasabov is an organized and motivated person, who constantly thinks of ways to
                    improve.</p>

                <p>Reverse Engineer & Build Ugly Prototypes First.</p>

                <p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the
                    code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a
                    reference.</p>

                <h5>My Short Term Goals</h5>
                <hr>
                <p>Preparations for the world after university are of high priority to me.
                    For this goal I intend on learning as much as I can on my own as well as at work,
                    to become the best possible engineer in the future.</p>
                <p>Aside from building small projects I would love to enter a position where I can be part of a bigger
                    team and learn from others with more experience than myself.</p>
